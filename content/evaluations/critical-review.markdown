## Description of the task:

You have to select a scientific paper published in one of the journal in the list of the [Financial Times Top 50 list](https://www.ft.com/content/3405a512-5cbb-11e1-8f1f-00144feabdc0), on a preprint repository like [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/), or in a top tier journal in your field of research **containing an experimental study**, and comment on the methodology, the statistical analyses and the report of the statistical results in the paper. The paper has to contain statistical analyses seen in the class (i.e., analysis of variance, possibly including covariates, mediation analysis and repeated measures). If your selected paper has more than one study, you can select only one for the task.

You need to send a copy of your selected paper for approval **prior** to do your peer review, which should be at most two pages long.

You can consider the following elements in your review:

-   Strengths and weaknesses of the methodology used to test the research hypotheses.
-   Appropriateness of experimental design and the choice dependent variables, control variables, treatment
    conditions.
-   Appropriateness of statistical analyses.
-   Presentation and discussion of the results (e.g., descriptive statistics, estimation of effect sizes, power calculations, etc.)
-   Discussion of the limits of the study
-   Possible sources of bias
-   Pre-registration, reproducibility and transparency of the study. Assessment of the potential for replicability.

In addition to the material seen in class, see Wilkinson (1999) and Campion (1993) to inform your review.

Note that many element of your review may be positive if the paper has already been published (especially in a top scientific journal, even if this is no guarantee of correctness).
